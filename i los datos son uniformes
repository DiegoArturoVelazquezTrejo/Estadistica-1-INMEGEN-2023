     ## Default S3 method:
     ks.test(x, y, ...,
             alternative = c("two.sided", "less", "greater"),
             exact = NULL, simulate.p.value = FALSE, B = 2000)

     ks.test(formula, data, subset, na.action, ...)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: a numeric vector of data values.

       y: either a numeric vector of data values, or a character string
          naming a cumulative distribution function or an actual
          cumulative distribution function such as ‘pnorm’.  Only
          continuous CDFs are valid.

     ...: for the default method, parameters of the distribution
          specified (as a character string) by ‘y’.  Otherwise, further
          arguments to be passed to or from methods.

alternative: indicates the alternative hypothesis and must be one of
          ‘"two.sided"’ (default), ‘"less"’, or ‘"greater"’.  You can
          specify just the initial letter of the value, but the
          argument name must be given in full.  See ‘Details’ for the
          meanings of the possible values.

   exact: ‘NULL’ or a logical indicating whether an exact p-value
          should be computed.  See ‘Details’ for the meaning of ‘NULL’.

simulate.p.value: a logical indicating whether to compute p-values by
          Monte Carlo simulation.

       B: an integer specifying the number of replicates used in the
          Monte Carlo test.

 formula: a formula of the form ‘lhs ~ rhs’ where ‘lhs’ is a numeric
          variable giving the data values and ‘rhs’ either ‘1’ for a
          one-sample test or a factor with two levels giving the
          corresponding groups for a two-sample test.

    data: an optional matrix or data frame (or similar: see
          ‘model.frame’) containing the variables in the formula
          ‘formula’.  By default the variables are taken from
          ‘environment(formula)’.

  subset: an optional vector specifying a subset of observations to be
          used.

na.action: a function which indicates what should happen when the data
          contain ‘NA’s.  Defaults to ‘getOption("na.action")’.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     If ‘y’ is numeric, a two-sample (Smirnov) test of the null
     hypothesis that ‘x’ and ‘y’ were drawn from the same _continuous_
     distribution is performed.

     Alternatively, ‘y’ can be a character string naming a continuous
     (cumulative) distribution function, or such a function.  In this
     case, a one-sample (Kolmogorov) test is carried out of the null
     that the distribution function which generated ‘x’ is distribution
     ‘y’ with parameters specified by ‘...’.

     The presence of ties always generates a warning, since continuous
     distributions do not generate them.  If the ties arose from
     rounding the tests may be approximately valid, but even modest
     amounts of rounding can have a significant effect on the
     calculated statistic.

     Missing values are silently omitted from ‘x’ and (in the
     two-sample case) ‘y’.

     The possible values ‘"two.sided"’, ‘"less"’ and ‘"greater"’ of
     ‘alternative’ specify the null hypothesis that the true
     distribution function of ‘x’ is equal to, not less than or not
     greater than the hypothesized distribution function (one-sample
     case) or the distribution function of ‘y’ (two-sample case),
     respectively.  This is a comparison of cumulative distribution
     functions, and the test statistic is the maximum difference in
     value, with the statistic in the ‘"greater"’ alternative being D^+
     = max[F_x(u) - F_y(u)].  Thus in the two-sample case ‘alternative
     = "greater"’ includes distributions for which ‘x’ is
     stochastically _smaller_ than ‘y’ (the CDF of ‘x’ lies above and
     hence to the left of that for ‘y’), in contrast to ‘t.test’ or
     ‘wilcox.test’.

     Exact p-values are not available for the one-sample case in the
     presence of ties.  If ‘exact = NULL’ (the default), an exact
     p-value is computed if the sample size is less than 100 in the
     one-sample case _and there are no ties_, and if the product of the
     sample sizes is less than 10000 in the two-sample case, with or
     without ties (using the algorithm described in Schröer and
     Trenkler, 1995).  Otherwise, asymptotic distributions are used
     whose approximations may be inaccurate in small samples.  In the
     one-sample two-sided case, exact p-values are obtained as
     described in Marsaglia, Tsang & Wang (2003) (but not using the
     optional approximation in the right tail, so this can be slow for
     small p-values).  The formula of Birnbaum & Tingey (1951) is used
     for the one-sample one-sided case.

     If a one-sample test is used, the parameters specified in ‘...’
     must be pre-specified and not estimated from the data.  There is
     some more refined distribution theory for the KS test with
     estimated parameters (see Durbin, 1973), but that is not
     implemented in ‘ks.test’.

_V_a_l_u_e:

     A list inheriting from classes ‘"ks.test"’ and ‘"htest"’
     containing the following components:

statistic: the value of the test statistic.

 p.value: the p-value of the test.

alternative: a character string describing the alternative hypothesis.

  method: a character string indicating what type of test was
          performed.

data.name: a character string giving the name(s) of the data.

_S_o_u_r_c_e:

     The two-sided one-sample distribution comes _via_ Marsaglia, Tsang
     and Wang (2003).

     Exact distributions for the two-sample (Smirnov) test are computed
     by the algorithm proposed Schröer (1991) and Schröer & Trenkler
     (1995).
